## Testing with OpenAI API

When testing functionality that uses the OpenAI API:

1. Get your own API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/).
2. Set it as an environment variable before running the script:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'

3. Be mindful of API usage costs when running tests.

## Code Style

Please follow these guidelines when contributing code:

- **Imports**: Group standard library, third-party, and local imports with a blank line between groups. Use absolute imports.
- **Formatting**: Use 4 spaces for indentation.
- **Naming**: Use snake_case for variables and functions, CamelCase for classes. Use descriptive names.
- **Logging**: Use the logger module with appropriate log levels (debug, info, error) rather than print statements.
- **Comments**: Include docstrings for classes and functions following the triple-quote style.
