# Android Resource Translator

*WIP*

**Android Resource Translator** scans your `strings.xml` files for missing translations and automatically translates them using AI language models (OpenAI or OpenRouter).

## GitHub Actions Workflow Examples

### Simple Example (Using OpenRouter with Gemini - Default)

If you want to quickly try out the action with minimal configuration, add this step to your workflow. This uses the default provider (OpenRouter) and model (Gemini google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-09-2025):

```yaml
- name: Run Android Resource Translator
  uses: duartebarbosadev/AndroidResourceTranslator@v1
  env:
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENROUTER_API_KEY }}
```

### Simple Example (Using OpenAI)

```yaml
- name: Run Android Resource Translator
  uses: duartebarbosadev/AndroidResourceTranslator@v1
  with:
    llm_provider: openai
    model: gpt-4o-mini
  env:
    OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
```

### Advanced Workflow Example

For a more complete setup—including checking out your repository, running the translator with additional options, and automatically creating a pull request with the translation report—use the following workflow snippet:

```yaml
name: Auto-translate strings.xml

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - '**/values/strings.xml' # Call only when strings.xml is updated
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write

concurrency:
  group: "${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}"
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  perform-auto-translate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 15

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Translate strings.xml to supported languages
        id: translate
        uses: duartebarbosadev/AndroidResourceTranslator@v1
        with:
          llm_provider: openrouter
          model: google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-09-2025
          # (Optional inputs)
          #resources_paths: "./app/src/main/res"  # default with no value will search entire project automatically
          #log_trace: "true" #default is false
          #ignore_folders: "build" # Default will follow .gitignore
          #project_context: "Your project context here" # (Default is no context)
          #openrouter_send_site_info: "false" # Set to false to disable sending site info to OpenRouter
          #include_reference_context: "false" # Disable sharing existing translations as prompt context
          #reference_context_limit: "10" # Reduce or increase how many examples are sent
        env:
          OPENROUTER_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENROUTER_API_KEY }}

      - name: Persist translation report
        run: |
          cat <<'EOF' > translation-report.md
          ${{ steps.translate.outputs.translation_report }}

          ---
          This pull request was automatically generated.
          EOF

      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v7

```

### ⚠️ API Usage and Pricing Considerations

Please note that each time the action runs, it will process **all** missing translations. This can impact your API usage and associated costs, especially for large projects with many strings or frequent commits. Meaning that you should accept this action PR's as soon as possible to avoid repeating runs.

We recommend the model google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-09-2025 as it got the best results in our testing and is not as expensive as the bigger models.
## Local Execution

To run the translator on your local machine, execute:

```bash
python AndroidResourceTranslator.py /path/to/your/android/project
```

You can also pass additional parameters like `--project-context` or `--dry-run` (to only check for missing translations without translating) as needed.

## Configuration

The action supports the following inputs:

| Input                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Default Value                                                          | Optional | Example                                                                |

### Environment Variables (API Keys)

Set these as repository secrets and pass them via `env:` in your workflow:

| Variable                | Description                                      | Required For                    |

| **OPENAI_API_KEY**      | OpenAI API key                                   | OpenAI provider                 |
| **OPENROUTER_API_KEY**  | OpenRouter API key                               | OpenRouter provider             |

## Translation Report Output

After the translation process is executed, the action produces an output called `translation_report`. This report is generated in Markdown format and includes a detailed summary of all translations performed. The report contains:

- **Module Information:**  
  Each module found in your Android project is listed along with its language-specific resources.
- **Strings Translations:**  
  For each module and language, a table displays every key that was translated, including the original text and the resulting translation.
- **Plural Resources Translations:**  
  If plural resources were translated, the report shows each plural resource name along with a table listing each plural quantity (e.g., `one`, `few`, `many`) and their corresponding translations.

This output is particularly useful for manual review and validation. In the provided advanced workflow, the report is automatically inserted into the body of a pull request, allowing maintainers to inspect the changes before merging.
